easypack
========

A super simple build tool made in node to pack marked js and css files in a html file into single timestamped js and css file 

##Steps of using this example

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)

2. Download [examples](https://github.com/shaunakv1/easypack/archive/examples.zip)

3. At the same level as the main.html install easypack:
```
$ npm install easypack 
```

4. Then run the build.js 
```
$ node build.js
```

5. Thats it! You should see a index.html generated alongside main.html. Notice the difference between javascripts and css included between the two.
